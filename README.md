This portfolio is part of the HTML and CSS course of my Software Developer boot camp at the Tech Academy.<br>
Before this, I went through many projects to learn the fundimentals and while it's not perfect, I applied many lessons and teachings into this page.<br>
Just like me, This page will be ever improving. I will be adding a lot of Javascript as I move on to the next course.
